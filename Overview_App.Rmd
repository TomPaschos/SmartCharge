## Application Overview

This application is meant to simulate the change in electric vehicle (EV) charging demand based on changing various inputs that affect charging behavior.  Those inputs could be technological, such as reducing power draw to an EV charger, or economic, such as pricing discounts and rebates on the price of electricity.  Any combination of these things will have an affect for electricity demanded by consumers for EV charging.

Choose your own combination of inputs to see how you might be able to change demand!

### How Does it Actually Work?

These types of interventions have an affect on how responsive consumers might be and that responsiveness is measured by the change in electricity that's demanded.  That demand is represented by a line that shows energy (in Kilowatts or kW) over the 24 hours of the day.  That responsiveness is modelled in this application using price elasticities - the change in quantity demanded given a change in price.  These elasticity values, along with other values, are built into our model to show how demand might change at any given hour.  For more information on how we built this model, visit our [website](https://smartchargeproject.weebly.com/) and look for a copy of our Master's Project report.


### Electric Vehicle Charging and Why It's Important

Electric Vehicles are increasing in popularity and projections indicate that they're only going to become more popular.  California currently has the largest electric vehicle market in the U.S. and has an aim to put 5,000,000 zero emission vehicles on its roads by 2030.  With this massive increase, all of these vehicles need to charge from the grid.  

Grid operators and energy providers aren't just curious about *how much* electricity EVs will require for charging but *when* they'll charge. Why?  Because in the state of California, there's an oversupply of solar energy in the middle of the day that can often be wasted.  So, rather than have all these new EVs charge at times when the grid receives power mostly from fossil fuel sources, energy providers want to see if it's possible to have EVs charge using all of that extra solar energy.  Charging with renewable power can lessen the demand for fossil fuel based power in the evening, and decrease the excess supply of solar in the middle of the day.  This helps smooth out balance of supply and demand and creates a more predictable and reliable electricity grid.

### Why Was This App Built?

This Application was developed as part of the "Smart Charge" group Master's Project at the UC Santa Barbara's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. Information on the Bren School's master's projects can be found [here](https://www.bren.ucsb.edu/research/masters_projects_landing.htm).
